<h1>Performance Tests HowTo</h1>
<p>
By Sonia Dimitrov, Christof Marti, Andre Weinand<br>
2005/02/24<br>

<p>
The Eclipse performance test plugin (org.eclipse.test.performance)
provides infrastructure for instrumenting programs
to collect performance data and to assert that performance doesn't drop
below a baseline. The infrastructure is supported on Windows, Linux,
and MacOS X.

<p>
The first part of this document describes how performance tests are
written and executed, the <a href="#cloudscape">second part</a> explains how performance data is
collected in a database and how this database is installed and
configured.

<h2>Writing Performance Tests</h2>

<h3>Setting up the environment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>check out the following plug-ins from dev.eclipse.org.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>org.eclipse.test.performance</li>
    <li>org.eclipse.test.performance.win32 (for Windows only)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>you need org.junit</li>
  <li>add org.eclipse.test.performance to your test plug-in's dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing a performance test case</h3>

A performance test case is an ordinary JUnit test TestCase.
<ul>
<li>create a test case with test methods along the lines of:
<pre>
public void testMyOperation() {
	Performance perf= Performance.getDefault();
	PerformanceMeter performanceMeter= perf.<b>createPerformanceMeter</b>(perf.getDefaultScenarioId(this));
	try {
		for (int i= 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
			performanceMeter.<b>start</b>();
			toMeasure();
			performanceMeter.<b>stop</b>();
 		}
		performanceMeter.<b>commit</b>();
		perf.<b>assertPerformance</b>(performanceMeter);
 	} finally {
		performanceMeter.<b>dispose</b>();
 	}
 }
</pre>
</li>

<li>or create a test case extending <code>PerformanceTestCase</code>
which is a convenience class that makes the
use of <code>PerformanceMeter</code> transparent:
<pre>
public class MyPerformanceTestCase extends PeformanceTestCase {

	public void testMyOperation() {
		for (int i= 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
			<b>startMeasuring</b>();
			toMeasure();
			<b>stopMeasuring</b>();
		}
		<b>commitMeasurements</b>();
		<b>assertPerformance</b>();
	}
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>
The scenario id passed to <code>createPerformanceMeter(...)</code> must be unique in a single test run
and must be the same for each build. This enables comparisons between builds.
The <code>Peformance#getDefaultScenarioId(...)</code> methods are provided for convenience.
</li>

<li>
<code>PerformanceMeter</code> supports repeated measurements by multiple invocations
of the <code>start()</code>, <code>stop()</code> sequence. The call
to <code>commit()</code> is required before evaluation with <code>assertPerformance()</code>
and <code>dispose()</code> is required before releasing the meter.
</li>

<li>The first iterations of the above <code>for</code>-loop will generally take more time because the
code is not optimized by the JIT compiler yet. This can introduce some variance to the
measurements, especially if other tests run before and change in some way that affects
the JIT's optimization of the measured code. A simple way to stabilize the measurements
is to run the code a few times before the measurements start. Caches also need special
caution as they can affect the measurements.
</li>

<li>
As a rule of thumb the measured code should take at least 100ms on the target machine in
order for the measurements to be relevant. For example, Windows' and Linux 2.4's system time increases
in 10ms steps. In some cases the measured code can be invoked repeatedly to accumulate the
elapsed time, however, it should be kept in mind that JIT could optimize this more aggressively
than in real-world scenarios.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Participating in the performance summary (aka "Performance Fingerprint")</h3>

If the number of performance tests grows large, it becomes harder to
get a good overview of the performance characteristics of a build. A
solution for this problem is a performance summary chart that
tries to condense a small subset of key performance tests into a chart
that fits onto a single page. Currently the performance infrastructure 
supports two levels of summaries, one global and any number of "local" summaries.
A local summary is typically associated with a component.
<p>
A summary bar chart shows the performance development of about 20 tests relative to a
reference build in an easy to grasp red/green presentation.
<p>
<img alt="summary graph" src="FP_I200409240800_I200410050800.jpeg">
<p>
So dependent on the total number of components every Eclipse component can tag one or
two tests for inclusion in a global and up to 20 for a local performance summary.
Tests marked for the global summary are automatically included for a local summary.
<p>
Marking a test for inclusion is done by passing a performance meter
into the method Performance.tagAsGlobalSummary(...) or Performance.tagAsSummary(...).
Both methods should
be called outside of start/stop calls but it must be called before the
the call to commit().
<pre>
// ....
Performance perf= Performance.getDefault();
PerformanceMeter pm= perf.createPerformanceMeter(perf.getDefaultScenarioId(this));
perf.<b>tagAsGlobalSummary</b>(pm, "A Short Name", Dimension.CPU_TIME);
try {
	// ...
</pre>
<p>
In order to keep the overview graph small, only a single dimension (CPU_TIME, USED_JAVA_HEAP etc.) of
the test's data is shown and only a short name is used to label the
data (instead of the rather long scenario ID). Both the short label as
well as the dimension must be supplied in the calls to tagAsGlobalSummary and tagAsSummary.
The available dimensions can be found in <code>org.eclipse.test.performance.Dimension</code>.

<p>
The PerformanceTestCase provides similar methods that must be called
before startMeasuring():
<pre>
public class MyPerformanceTestCase extends PerformanceTestCase {

	public void testMyOperation() {
		<b>tagAsSummary</b>("A Short Name", Dimension.CPU_TIME);
		for (int i= 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
			startMeasuring();
			toMeasure();
			stopMeasuring();
		}
		commitMeasurements();
		assertPerformance();
	}
}</pre>

<h3>Running a performance test case (from a launch configuration)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>create a new JUnit Plug-in Test launch configuration for the test case</li>
  <li>add "-Xms256M -Xmx256M" or similar to the VM arguments to avoid memory pressure during the measurements</li>
  <li>run the launch configuration</li>
  <li>by default the measured averages of the performance monitor
are written to the console on <code>commit()</code>. This is
surpressed if performance tests are configured to store data in the
database (see below).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Running a performance test case (from the command-line)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this method is of particular interest, if you want to do precise measurements of a specific build</li>
  <li>export the following plug-ins as 'Deployable plug-ins' to the eclipse installation directory (not the 'plugins' directory; choose to deploy as
'a directory structure')</li>
  <ul>
    <li>org.eclipse.test</li>
    <li>org.eclipse.test.performance</li>
    <li>org.eclipse.test.performance.win32 (for Windows only)</li>
    <li>your test plug-in(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>copy the following .bat file and customize it to your needs (Windows):</li>
  <pre>
@echo off

REM Installation paths
SET ECLIPSEPATH=c:\eclipse
SET JVMPATH=c:\jdk\jdk1.4.2_05

REM Paths, relative to ECLIPSEPATH

pause
</pre>
  <li>after testing the setup you may want to close other applications to avoid distortion of the measurements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running a performance test case (within the Automated Testing Framework on each build)</h3>

If the <code>test.xml</code> of your test plug-in already exists
and looks similar to the <code>jdt.text.tests</code>' one, add targets
similar to those shown below. The <code>performance</code> target is
the entry point for performance testing like the <code>run</code> target
is for correctness testing.
<pre>
&lt;!-- This target defines the performance tests that need to be run. --&gt;
&lt;target name="performance-suite"&gt;
  &lt;property name="your-performance-folder" value="${eclipse-home}/your_performance_folder"/&gt;
  &lt;delete dir="${your-performance-folder}" quiet="true"/&gt;
  &lt;ant target="ui-test" antfile="${library-file}" dir="${eclipse-home}"&gt;
     &lt;property name="data-dir" value="${your-performance-folder}"/&gt;
     &lt;property name="plugin-name" value="${plugin-name}"/&gt;
     &lt;property name="classname" value="<em>&lt;your fully qualified test case class name&gt;</em>"/&gt;
  &lt;/ant&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
                    
&lt;!-- This target runs the performance test suite. Any actions that need to happen --&gt;
&lt;!-- after all the tests have been run should go here. --&gt;
&lt;target name="performance" depends="init,performance-suite,cleanup"&gt;
  &lt;ant target="collect" antfile="${library-file}" dir="${eclipse-home}"&gt;
    &lt;property name="includes" value="org*.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="output-file" value="${plugin-name}.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;/ant&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</pre>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>
Performance measurements are run on a dedicated performance measurement machine of the Releng team.
</li>
  
<li>
If you have created a new source folder, do not forget to include
it in the build (add it to the "build.properties" file).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running a performance test case (within the Automated Testing Framework, locally)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  	modify <code>test.xml</code> as described above
  </li>
  
  <li>
  	download a build and its accompanying test framework plug-ins contained 
    in eclipse-test-framework-*.zip
  </li>
  
  <li>
  	unzip the Eclipse SDK and the eclipse-test-framework zip to install your target Eclipse<br>
    (you need <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html">Info-ZIP 
    UnZip</a> version 5.41 or later (<a href="ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/infozip/WIN32/unz551xN.exe">Windows</a>) 
    installed and added to the path).
  </li>

  <li>
  	export your test plug-in as a 'Deployable plug-in' to the target Eclipse installed 
    	above; choose to export as directory structure.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  	open a terminal or command window and execute the follwoing (on a single line):<br>
  	<pre>
        java -jar <i><b>&lt;an eclipse install&gt;</i></b>/startup.jar
        -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner 
        -file <i><b>&lt;target eclipse install/plugins/your test plug-in id_version&gt;</b></i>/test.xml 
        performance
        -Dos=<i><b>&lt;os&gt;</b></i> -Dws=<i><b>&lt;ws&gt;</b></i> -Darch=<i><b>&lt;arch&gt;</b></i> -Declipse_home=<i><b>&lt;target eclipse install&gt;</b></i>
        &quot;-Dvmargs=-Xms256M -Xmx256M&quot;
        -logger org.apache.tools.ant.DefaultLogger
    </pre>
  </li>
  
  <li>
  	The JUnit results are written to an xml file in the root of the target Eclipse 
    	and the performance measurements are written to the console.
  </li>
    
</ul>

<h2><a name="cloudscape"></a>Setting up the Derby database</h2>

Performance tests are only valuable if measured data can be
monitored over time and compared against reference data.
For this functionality the Eclipse performance plugin makes use of
the Apache project's <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/derby/">Derby</a>
database (formerly called 
<a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/cloudscape/">Cloudscape</a>).
</p>
<p>Derby is a database engine written in Java that can be accessed
via JDBC. Derby is easily embeddable in Java programs or can run
as a network server.
</p>
<p>This section describes how to install Derby and how to
configure the performance test plugin to use Derby.

<h3>Getting and installing Derby</h3>

The performance infrastructure does not include Derby.
If you want to leverage Derby
you need to download and install it.

<p>
The performance plugin has an optional prereq for a "org.apche.derby"
library project. Since it is optional, you won't see any compile time
errors when loading the performance plugin from the Eclipse repository
and the Derby project is not available in your workspace. However
you'll see runtime errors when running the tests and trying to access
the database.<br>

<p>
If you have access to the following repository you can get the
org.apache.derby library project from there:
<pre>
  :pserver:anonymous@ottcvs1.ott.oti.com:/home/cvs/zrheclipse
</pre>
Otherwise get Derby from
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0408cline/index.html">here</a>.
Unpack the archive to any directory.
<br>
To create a library project for Derby, open the Java project
wizard and enter "org.eclipse.derby" as the project's name. Go to the next
page and select the "Libraries" tab. Remove the JRE and add the five
jar-files () from Derby's lib directory via the "Add External JARs"
button. Switch to the "Order and Export" tab and check all five
libraries. Press "Finish". Create a new file "plugin.xml" inside the
Derby project and paste the following contents into it:<br>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;?eclipse version="3.0"?&gt;
&lt;plugin
&nbsp;&nbsp; id="org.apache.derby"
&nbsp;&nbsp; name="Derby"
&nbsp;&nbsp; version="1.0.0"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;runtime&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name="db2jcc.jar"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/library&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name="db2jcc_license_c.jar"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/library&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name="derby.jar"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/library&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name="derbynet.jar"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/library&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name="derbytools.jar"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/library&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/runtime&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>

In addition you'll need to load the performance plugin
(org.eclipse.test.performance) and if you are running
on Windows the associated fragment (org.eclipse.test.performance.win32).


<h3>Configuring the performance plugin for using Derby</h3>

The performance test plugin is configured via the three Java properties
eclipse.perf.dbloc, eclipse.perf.config, and eclipse.perf.assertAgainst.
<p>
The eclipse.perf.dbloc specifies where the Derby DB is located.
If no value is given
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.dbloc=
</pre>
Derby runs in embedded mode (not as a separate server)
and the DB will live in your home directory.
<p>
If an absolute or relative path is given, Derby uses or creates
the DB in that location. E.g. with (Linux and MacOS X)
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.dbloc=/tmp/derby
</pre>
Derby runs in embedded mode and creates the database under
/tmp/derby.
<p>
To connect to a Derby server running locally (or remotely) use the
following:
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.dbloc=net://<i>tcp-ip address</i>
</pre>
With the properties eclipse.perf.config and eclipse.perf.assertAgainst
you specify the name under which performance data is stored in the
database and the name of the reference data to compare against. This
"name" is not a single string but a set of key/value pairs separated by
semicolons:
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.config=<i>key1</i>=<i>value1</i>;<i>key2</i>=<i>value2</i>;...;<i>keyn</i>=<i>valuen</i>
	-Declipse.perf.assertAgainst=<i>key1</i>=<i>value1</i>;<i>key2</i>=<i>value2</i>;...;<i>keyn</i>=<i>valuen</i>
</pre>
The key/value pairs can be used to associate the collected
performance data with information about the configuration that was used
to generate the data. Typically this includes the name of the build,
the system on which the test were run, or the used Java VM. So in this
example:
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.config=build=N20040914;host=relengwin;jvm=j9
</pre>
performance data for the nightly build N20040914 is stored in the
database under a "name" that consist of three key/value pairs.<br>
If the tests are run multiple times with the same arguments, the new
data does not replace
old data but is added under the same name. Programs that visualize the
data are expected
to aggregate the data for example by calculating the average of all
tests.

<p>
To assert that performance data collected for another build does not
degrade with respect to some reference data the assertAgainst property
is used similarly:
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.assertAgainst=build=R3.0;host=relengwin;jvm=j9
</pre>
This property enables any "assertPerformance" calls in your performance
tests and compares the newly measured data against the data specified
by the three key/value pairs. Please note that the order of the pairs
does not matter when looking up the data in the database. However, the
number of key/value pairs must be identical.
<p>
Because in most cases you want to store newly collected data as well as
assert against other reference data at the same time you'll need to
specify both properties. In this case only those key/value pairs must
be listed in the assertAgainst property, that differ from the config
property:
<pre>
	-Declipse.perf.config=build=N20040914;host=relengwin
	-Declipse.perf.assertAgainst=build=R3.0
</pre>
So in the example from above the new performance data is stored in the
database under the build name
"N20040914" and the host "relengwin" and the "assertPerformance"
compares this data against data tagged with a build name of "R3.0" and
an implicitely specified host "relengwin".
<p>
If you want to assert the average of multiple runs (instead of the data
of a single run)
against the reference data, do the following:
<pre>
	// Run program 4 times to collect data under build name "I20040914"
	... -Declipse.perf.config=build=I20040914
	... -Declipse.perf.config=build=I20040914
	... -Declipse.perf.config=build=I20040914
	... -Declipse.perf.config=build=I20040914
	
	// Run program a 5th time and collect more data under I20040914
	// and assert the average of 5 runs of I20040914 against some baseline data
	... -Declipse.perf.config=build=I20040914 -Declipse.perf.assertAgainst=build=R3.0
</pre>

<h3>Viewing the data</h3>

Since we do not (yet) have fancy visualization tools, the performance
test plugin provides a class <code>org.eclipse.test.internal.performance.db.View</code>
that can be run as a standalone program for viewing the data contained in the database in a tabular format.
<p>
You need to specify the database location via the <code>eclipse.perf.dbloc</code>
property (most easily done via a launch configuration).
Select the data to view by either specifying a variation via the <code>eclipse.perf.config</code> property or
by directly setting the key/value pairs of the variation at the beginning of the program's <code>main</code> method.
If you only want to view specific scenarios, use an appropriate pattern for the local variable <code>scenarioPattern</code>.
The local variable <code>seriesKey</code> specifies what variation is shown on the x-axis of the table.
<p>
So the following setup:
<pre>
public class View {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Variations <b>variations</b>= PerformanceTestPlugin.getVariations();
        variations.put("host", "relengwin");
        variations.put("build", "I%");
        
        String <b>scenarioPattern</b>= "%RevertJavaEditorTest%";

        String <b>seriesKey</b>= "build";
        
    	// ...
</pre>
creates a table showing all dimensions of the (single) scenario selected by the pattern 
"<code>%testRevertJavaEditor%</code>" for all integration builds (that is builds starting with a capital 'I').
<pre>
Scenario: org.eclipse.jdt.text.tests.performance.RevertJavaEditorTest#testRevertJavaEditor()
Builds:              I200409240800    I200409281200  I200410050800  I200410190941  I200410260800

</pre>

If you are interested in creating performance charts and tables similar to those available on the eclipse platform
download pages, you could try the stand-alone java program org.eclipse.test.performance.ui.Main stored in the
org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder project. Refer to the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/plugins/org.eclipse.test.performance.ui/readme.html?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/html">readme.html</a> in 
org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/plugins/org.eclipse.test.performance.ui for more details.

<h3>How to setup a Derby server (on Linux and MacOS X)</h3>

<ul>

<li>Either get Derby from the repository or from <a
 href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0408cline/index.html">here</a>.
</li>

<li>Get the (Bourne) shell script "derby.sh" from the scripts folder of <code>org.eclipse.test.performance</code>
and install it on the server
(rename it to "derby" and make it executable; if you've checked out the
file on Windows and copied it to Linux,
it might be necessary to convert line delimiters with the dos2unix
tool).
The script simplifies the usage of the Derby tools - especially
starting and stopping the server - because
it sets the correct classpath and some important properties.
</li>
 
<li>Edit the script and adapt the variables <code>CSLIB</code>, <code>DBROOT</code>,
and <code>JAVA</code>
to your installation. <code>CSLIB</code> should point to the directory
containing the Derby jars.
If you've used the Derby installer, then this is the lib directory
inside the Cloudscape 10.0 directory.
If you are using the org.apache.derby project from the repository, then this
is just the project folder.
</li>

<li>in a Shell execute
<pre>
	derby start &amp;
</pre>
to launch the server in background. The server will send this to
stdout:
<pre>
	Server is ready to accept connections on port 1527.
</pre>
to the console.
</li>

<li>stop the server with
<pre>
	derby stop
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
